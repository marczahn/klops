### Simple Tetris-inspired game

Klops is a small game which is inspired by Tetris (obviously). It is a playground for me to get into Typescript, Gatsby, fe testing etc.

At the moment it feels a little clunky because amongst rendering the matrix with a react component.

The aim is a a multiplayer game with coop, "deathmatch" and "team deathmatch" - Or alone, of course. This is supposed to be implemented with websockets.
