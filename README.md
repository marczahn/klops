### Simple Tetris-inspired game

Klops is a small game which is inspired by Tetris (obviously). It is a playground for me to get into Typescript, Gatsby, fe testing etc.

At the moment it feels a little clunky because amongst rendering the matrix with a react component.

There are these aims:

* multiplayer with coop, "deathmatch" and "team deathmatch"
* frontend based configuration of blocks
* websockets
